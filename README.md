This is my initial project for a Kanban Board.  
This project has as its only purpose to practice my React skills.  
I want to ground some of the basic concepts and this first project can help with that.  
You can watch the deployment here :  https://memoregalado.github.io/Kanban-Board-in-React/

# Updates soon - Working on  
I'll add a configuration page, so you can configure the quantity and title of the columns.  
I'll add the 'drag and drop' funcionality, definitely.  
~~I'll add handle of local storage.~~  
~~I'll add handle of color themes (day and night).~~  
~~I'll change all the SVG to React Icons.~~  
~~I've read a lot about styled components, so I'll change all the project to using them.~~  
~~I'm thinking about if I should put an 'undone' message after the delete, I'm not sure how that should be programmed, but definitely worth looking into.~~  
~~I'll add a confirm message before deleting.~~

Added Local Storage.
Right now, the mode chosen and the stories which you have created remain in the local storage of your browser.
So, the next time you return to the page, the mode and the stories persist!

The project now has dark/light mode!!  
The whole project was changed to styled-components!!  
It is a very interesting library, however, I'm not sure if I made the implementation in the most efficient way. I'll keep researching that.  
Also, I changed all the SVG icons by React Icons.
