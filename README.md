This is my initial project for a Kanban Board
This project is made as practice for my React skills.  
I want to ground some of the basic concepts and this first project can help with that.
You can watch the deployment here :  https://memoregalado.github.io/Kanban-Board-in-React/

# Updates soon - Working on 
I'll add handle of color themes (day and night).  
I'll change all the SVG to React Icons.  
I'll add the 'drag and drop' funcionality, definitely.  
~~I've read a lot about styled components, so I'll change all the project to using them.~~  
~~I'm thinking about if I should put an 'undone' message after the delete, I'm not sure how that should be programmed, but definitely worth looking into.~~  
~~I'll add a confirm message before deleting.~~
