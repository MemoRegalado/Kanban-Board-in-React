This is my initial project for a Kanban Board

This project is made as practice for my React skills.
I want to ground some of the basic concepts and this first project can help with that.

# Updates soon - Working on 
I will add a title counter for every column so we can know how many stories each column has. 
~~I'll add a new modal window to create the new stories~~

# 2022/12/27
I added a modal window to create the new stories.
The Modal Component is very flexible because we can configure every button action.

# 2022/11/23
I added a button to add stories.
The stories moves with a click
