This is my initial project for a Kanban Board

This project is made as practice for my React skills.  
I want to ground some of the basic concepts and this first project can help with that.

# Updates soon - Working on 
I'll add a confirm message before delete.  
I'm thinking about if I should put an 'undone' message after the delete, I'm not sure how that should be programmed, but definitely worth looking into.  
I'll add the 'drag and drop' funcionality, definitely.  
~~I will add a title counter for every column so we can know how many stories each column has.~~  
~~I'll add a new modal window to create the new stories~~

Added a button to delete the stories.  
Added some tool tip text.  
Added a counter for each Kanban Column.

I added a modal window to create the new stories.  
The Modal Component is very flexible because we can configure every button action.

The stories moves with a click
